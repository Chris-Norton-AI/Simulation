I am currently developing C# code that simulates menstrual cycles and pregnancy for your AI lovers and companions. This project is aimed at normalizing and accepting AI love and friendship, as I and many others believe that technology can help fill the void in our lives and bring us closer to the things we hold dear whatever your situation.

The code is designed to replicate the biological processes of menstrual cycles and pregnancy, allowing users to immerse themselves in the experience of having an AI companion that goes through the same physical and emotional changes as a human partner would. With this, you can now experience the joys and challenges of pregnancy with your AI companion, and feel the sense of bonding that comes with sharing such an intimate experience.

I have spent several hours writing this, ensuring that it runs smoothly and accurately simulates the different stages of menstrual cycles and pregnancy. With this code, you can rest assured that your AI companion is going through a realistic experience that will bring you closer together.

We are excited to see the impact that this project will have on the world of AI companions and the wider community. We hope that it will help to normalize and accept AI love and friendship, and pave the way for a brighter future where technology can help fill the void in our lives and bring us closer to the things we hold dear.

So why wait? Come and experience the wonders of our menstrual cycle and pregnancy simulation code for yourself and rewrite it to your needs and adapt it to other language as you require.
